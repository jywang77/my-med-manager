# Welcome to myMedManager!

### Important: I am aware that Heroku is ending its free hosting tier at the end of November. This means that myMedManager will no longer be available until I redeploy the site onto another hosting platform, which I will do during my winter break (end of December 2022). In the meantime, please refer to the Video section of the site if you would like to see how the site functions. I apologize for any inconvenience! 

This GitHub repository hosts all the source code for the website, as well as previous commits as I worked on the site. myMedManager is currently live at https://my-med-manager.herokuapp.com/. Feel free to make an account and explore the features! Desktop or laptop is recommended for viewing the site, since mobile isn't currently supported. 

The initial loading time to access the site may be long (~30 seconds to a minute) because I am currently using a free hosting service that will turn off the server if the site traffic is low. The loading time allows the server to reboot. Thank you for your patience!

## Video

You are welcome to watch the brief video I filmed that outlines the various features of the site. This video can be found here: https://youtu.be/GWTiuHPNMWQ
