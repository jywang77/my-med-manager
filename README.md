# Welcome to myMedManager!

This GitHub repository hosts all the source code for the website, as well as previous commits as I worked on the site. myMedManager is currently live at https://mymedmanager.cyclic.app/. Feel free to make an account and explore the features! Desktop or laptop is recommended for viewing the site, since mobile isn't currently supported.

The initial loading time to access the site may be long because I am currently using a free hosting service. Thank you for your patience!
