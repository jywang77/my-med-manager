# Welcome to myMedManager!

This GitHub repository hosts all the source code for the website, as well as previous commits as I worked on the site. myMedManager is currently live at <url>. Feel free to make an account and explore the features!

The initial loading time to access the site may be long (~30 seconds to a minute) because I am currently using a free hosting service that will turn off the server if the site traffic is low. The loading time allows the server to reboot. Thank you for your patience!

## Video

You are welcome to watch the brief video I filmed that outlines the various features of the site. This video can be found here: <url>
